Using Machine Learning classifiers from scikit-learn on real world datasets

For every Machine Learning algorithm I do from scratch, here is a scikit learn equivalent that has been applied to real world data sets.
Scikit learn is a very simple module to work with. It is also very well documented so that you are able to customize the algorithm to fit your needs.
It also goes without saying that the algorithms are way more efficient than what we have written from scratch.

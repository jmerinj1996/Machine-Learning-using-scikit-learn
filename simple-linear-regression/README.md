### Things to note:
* The dataset used here is the kc_house data from Kaggle
* The only two columns dropped are the date and the id column since they do not contribute to the classification.
* Preprocessing the featureset made the accuracy go higher.
* The last 20 records were seperated for prediction.
* The accuracy on using a simple linear regression algorithm on the dataset is about 70%
